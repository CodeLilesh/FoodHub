build a Food Ordering App with a User Side (for customers) and an Admin Panel (for restaurant owners or your admin team), using Kotlin.

Here’s a clear and modern recommendation for tech stack and platform:
📱 User Side App (Customer App)

    Platform: Android (using Android Studio)

    Language: Kotlin (perfect choice)

    UI Framework: Android Jetpack Compose (newer, faster, declarative UI building) or XML (traditional)

    Architecture: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) + Repository Pattern

    State Management: LiveData / Kotlin Flow

    Network: Retrofit (for API calls)

    Database: Room (for local storage)

    Image Loading: Coil (modern Kotlin image library)

    Authentication: Firebase Authentication (simple setup for login/signup)

    Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

🖥️ Admin Panel (Dashboard for Restaurant Owners/Admin)

Here you have two good options:
Option	Stack	Notes
1. Android App	Android Studio + Kotlin	If you want Admin Panel also as an Android App. Good for mobile use.
2. Web App (recommended)	Frontend: React.js or Angular
Backend: Django REST API or Node.js	Professional and scalable. Admins typically prefer Web Dashboard.

✅ If you want only Android-based: Build both User and Admin Panel in Android Studio using Kotlin.

✅ If you want a more professional setup:

    User App: Kotlin Android App (Android Studio)

    Admin Panel: Web App (React.js + Django or Node.js backend)

🌐 Backend (common for both User and Admin apps)

    Backend Framework: Django (Python) or Node.js (JavaScript)

    Database: PostgreSQL (preferred) or MySQL

    Hosting: AWS / Heroku / DigitalOcean (start cheap, scale later)

    APIs: REST APIs (standard way)

    Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

[Admin Panel (Web App or Kotlin App)] ---> [Backend APIs] ---> [Database]

🔥 Extra Features to consider

    Payment Integration (Razorpay / Stripe)

    Google Maps API for Delivery Tracking

    Admin can Add/Edit/Delete Menu Items

    Admin can View/Update Orders

    OTP Login for Users

🛠️ In short:

    User App → Kotlin + Android Studio

    Admin Panel → Web App (React.js + Django REST) (recommended) or another Kotlin Android App

    Backend → Django or Node.js + PostgreSQL/MySQL
